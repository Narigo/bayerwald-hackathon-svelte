## Development

To run the application locally, you need to set up the database first by running setup mode once:

```sh
./dev.sh setup
```

If everything worked and database exists, you can stop the setup mode and start in production mode:

```sh
./dev.sh stop
./dev.sh start
```

When done, use `./dev.sh stop`.
